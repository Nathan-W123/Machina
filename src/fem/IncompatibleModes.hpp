/// \brief The non-linear kernels of the incompatible-mode Hex8
///        (Hex8Incompatible.hpp): the local Newton iteration for the nine
///        mode parameters and the static condensation of the force, the
///        tangent and the thermal load rate. Internal to the library; the
///        public entry points are `elastoplastic_element`,
///        `elastoplastic_stress`, `total_lagrangian_element` and
///        `total_lagrangian_stress`, which dispatch here.
///
/// **The augmented element.** With the parameters \f$\alpha\f$ of the three
/// modes as the displacements of three pseudo-nodes whose reference
/// gradients are the Taylor-corrected \f$\tilde g_k\f$, the displacement
/// gradient at a point is \f$H = U G^T + A\tilde G^T\f$ and the element is
/// an eleven-node element of 33 degrees of freedom \f$(u, \alpha)\f$: its
/// force \f$r = (f_u, r_\alpha)\f$ and tangent
/// \f$\begin{bmatrix}K_{uu} & K_{u\alpha}\\ K_{\alpha u} & K_{\alpha\alpha}\end{bmatrix}\f$
/// are those of Elastoplastic.hpp and TotalLagrangian.hpp on the augmented
/// gradients - small strain, finite (Green-Lagrange) and logarithmic
/// kinematics alike, with the same returns (J2, Hill48, Chaboche) and the
/// same hyperelastic laws.
///
/// **Local solve.** The modes are internal: they carry no load, so
/// \f$r_\alpha(u, \alpha) = 0\f$. On every evaluation the parameters are
/// found by Newton's method *from the committed parameters* \f$\alpha_n\f$
/// (those of the last converged step), never from the last trial:
/// \f[
///   \alpha^{(0)} = \alpha_n ,\qquad
///   \alpha^{(i+1)} = \alpha^{(i)} - K_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1} r_\alpha ,
/// \f]
/// with every point's return from its committed state, so the element is a
/// pure function of \f$(u, \lambda)\f$ and the committed history - which is
/// what the line search, the step cuts, the arc length and the parallel
/// evaluation rely on (the Simo-Rifai update of \f$\alpha\f$ with the global
/// iterate is not, and is not used). It stops when
/// \f$\|r_\alpha\|_\infty \le 10^{-8}\f$ times the gross scale
/// \f$\max_i\sum_q w_q\,|\tilde B_q|^T|\sigma_q|\f$ of the sums that form it
/// (the condensed force below is then exact to the square of that), plus
/// a round-off floor of \f$10^{-13}\max_i\sum_q w_q|\tilde B_q|^T 1\,
/// |C_q|\,|H_q|(1 + |H_q|)\f$ - the forces of a strain error of that
/// relative size, which is all a rigid rotation leaves; it
/// throws SolverError, which cuts the step, after 25 iterations or at a
/// singular \f$K_{\alpha\alpha}\f$. Near the solution the full Newton
/// step is taken. Far from it - a return far from its committed state, a
/// load reversal, a start without the committed parameters - the points
/// switch between elastic and plastic along the step, \f$r_\alpha\f$ is
/// only piecewise smooth and Newton's iterates can cycle, and
/// \f$\|r_\alpha\|\f$ is no merit function; a step that does not reduce
/// it is shortened by a line search on the directional residual
/// \f$\phi(s) = d^T r_\alpha(\alpha + s d)\f$ (regula falsi, Crisfield
/// 1991, *Non-linear finite element analysis of solids and structures*
/// vol. 1, sec. 9.3), whose root minimises the incremental potential along
/// the direction wherever there is one (an associative return, a
/// hyperelastic law), each trial kept a tenth of the bracket from its ends;
/// where \f$\phi\f$ brackets no root on the step (\f$K_{\alpha\alpha}\f$ not
/// positive definite, a non-convex potential) the step is halved on
/// \f$\|r_\alpha\|\f$ and the best trial kept. Elastic small strain is
/// linear in \f$\alpha\f$ and
/// converges in one iteration.
///
/// **Condensation** at the converged parameters:
/// \f[
///   K^* = K_{uu} - K_{u\alpha}K_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1}K_{\alpha u} ,\qquad
///   f^* = f_u - K_{u\alpha}K_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1}r_\alpha ,\qquad
///   q^* = q_u - K_{u\alpha}K_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1}q_\alpha ,
/// \f]
/// the derivative of \f$f^*(u) = f_u(u, \alpha(u))\f$ with
/// \f$d\alpha/du = -K_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1}K_{\alpha u}\f$; the term in
/// \f$r_\alpha\f$ is the last Newton correction, which makes the error of
/// \f$f^*\f$ quadratic in the local residual; q is the thermal load rate.
/// \f$K_{\alpha u}\f$ is not \f$K_{u\alpha}^T\f$ when the material tangent
/// is not symmetric (Chaboche), and \f$K^*\f$ is then left non-symmetric.
///
/// **Storage.** Everything runs on fixed-size Eigen matrices (6 x 33 strain
/// operators, 9 x 9, 24 x 9 and 24 x 24 blocks) in a per-thread workspace
/// that is reused: the local iteration allocates nothing.
///
/// **Mean dilatation** is not combined with the modes (see
/// docs/formulation.md): averaging the dilatation of the augmented element
/// leaves a zero-energy mode (the field \f$u = \kappa(xz, yz,
/// \tfrac12(z^2 - x^2 - y^2))\f$, whose strain \f$\kappa z\,I\f$ averages to
/// nothing), and averaging only the compatible dilatation leaves a sheet
/// of one element through its thickness a fraction of its bending
/// stiffness. The modes themselves relax the isochoric constraint of plastic
/// flow: they absorb the linear part of every point's dilatation.
