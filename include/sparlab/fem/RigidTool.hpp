/// \brief Rigid forming tools that travel along tabulated paths, and their
///        penalty contact with a surface of the model in the current
///        configuration, with Coulomb friction.
///
/// **Tools.** A tool is a rigid body given analytically - a sphere (the
/// hemispherical tip of an incremental-forming stylus), a plane (a backing
/// plate, a flat punch) or an infinite cylinder (a roller) - whose reference
/// point follows a piecewise-linear trajectory c(t) in pseudo-time: the
/// sphere's centre, a point of the plane, a point of the cylinder's axis.
/// The tool translates; it does not rotate (no tool spin).
///
/// **Contact (penalty, current configuration, large sliding).** Each tool
/// acts on the nodes of a slave surface of the model, the boundary faces
/// whose nodes all lie in a region (as a pressure selects them). The gap of
/// slave node j at the current position \f$x = X_j + u_j\f$ is evaluated
/// exactly, with no linearisation of the geometry, so a tool may travel any
/// distance over the sheet: for the sphere of radius R
/// \f[
///   r = x - c(t),\quad d = |r|,\quad n = r/d,\quad g = d - R ;
/// \f]
/// for the plane with unit normal n (out of the tool, towards the body)
/// \f$g = n\cdot(x - c(t))\f$; for the cylinder with unit axis a, r is
/// taken normal to the axis, \f$r_\perp = (I - aa^T)(x - c)\f$. Where
/// \f$g < 0\f$ the node penetrates the tool and takes the normal force
/// \f[
///   f_N = -\kappa_j A_j\, g\, n = p_N\, n, \qquad p_N = -\kappa_j A_j\, g > 0 ,
/// \f]
/// with \f$A_j = \sum_f \int N_j\,dA\f$ the node's tributary area on the
/// selected reference faces (times the thickness in 2-D) and the penalty
/// stiffness \f$\kappa_j = s E_j / h_j\f$ [Pa/m]: s the penalty scale
/// (default 10), \f$E_j\f$ the largest Young's modulus of the adjacent faces'
/// elements and \f$h_j = \sqrt{A_j}\f$ (3-D) or \f$A_j/t\f$ (2-D) the node's
/// characteristic size, so that the node's spring \f$\kappa_j A_j \approx
/// s E_j h_j\f$ is s times the stiffness of an element of that size. The
/// penetration this leaves is about \f$p\,h/(sE)\f$ for a contact pressure
/// p (4 um for 300 MPa, 1 mm and aluminium at s = 10). The contact force is
/// an external force: it enters the residual \f$R = f_{int} - f_{ext}\f$ as
/// \f$-f_N\f$, and its exact tangent (a node-diagonal block) is
/// \f[
///   \partial(-f_N)/\partial x = \kappa_j A_j \left[ n n^T + g\,\partial n/\partial x \right],
///   \qquad \partial n/\partial x = (I - nn^T)/d
/// \f]
/// for the sphere (\f$(I - aa^T - nn^T)/d\f$ for the cylinder, 0 for the
/// plane): symmetric, the curvature term softening it tangentially.
///
/// **Friction** is regularised Coulomb friction by an elastic-slip return
/// map (backward Euler over an increment), with a history per slave node
/// and tool: the tangential force \f$F_T\f$ on the node and the node's
/// position relative to the tool, \f$q = x - c\f$, both at the last
/// converged increment. At a state (x, t):
/// * the committed force is transported onto the current tangent plane,
///   \f$\tilde F = F_T - (F_T\cdot n)n\f$, rescaled to keep its magnitude,
///   \f$\hat F = |F_T|\,\tilde F/|\tilde F|\f$;
/// * the slip increment is the tangential relative motion
///   \f$\delta = (I - nn^T)(x - c(t) - q)\f$ (for a node that was not in
///   contact at the last converged increment, \f$F_T = 0\f$ and q is its
///   relative position at the start of the increment);
/// * the trial force \f$F^{tr} = \hat F - \kappa_{T,j} A_j\,\delta\f$,
///   \f$\kappa_T = \rho_T \kappa\f$ with the tangential penalty ratio
///   \f$\rho_T\f$ (default 1);
/// * stick where \f$|F^{tr}| \le \mu p_N\f$, \f$F_T = F^{tr}\f$; slip
///   otherwise, \f$F_T = \mu p_N\,F^{tr}/|F^{tr}|\f$.
///
/// The force on the node is \f$f_N + F_T\f$. The tangent is the exact
/// derivative of that force at fixed history - transport, projection, the
/// normal force in the slip cone and the normalisation included - which is
/// not symmetric; `FrictionTangent::Symmetric` uses its symmetric part
/// instead (a symmetric factorisation, slower Newton convergence). A node
/// that leaves contact loses its history. The history is keyed by mesh node,
/// so it does not depend on the Dirichlet partition of an analysis step.
///
/// **Search.** Before each increment, from the converged state
/// \f$u_0\f$ at \f$t_0\f$ to \f$t_1\f$, a node is a candidate for tool k if
/// its position \f$x_j(u_0)\f$ lies within \f$R + m\f$ of the segment
/// \f$[c(t_0), c(t_1)]\f$ the tool's reference point sweeps (increments
/// never cross a trajectory knot, so c moves on that segment), where the
/// margin m bounds how far a node may move in the increment. Every
/// evaluation checks that bound: if some slave node of the tool has moved
/// more than m from \f$x_j(u_0)\f$, that evaluation takes all of the tool's
/// slave nodes. A node left out therefore provably has
/// \f$|x_j - c(t)| > R\f$ for every t of the increment, g > 0: the filter
/// never changes the result.
///
/// **Units.** Strict SI: positions [m], times [s] (pseudo-time),
/// forces [N], penalty stiffness [Pa/m].
