/// \brief Explicit dynamics: the central-difference method with a lumped
///        mass, the stable time step, uniform and selective mass scaling,
///        mass-proportional damping, penalty contact with moving rigid
///        tools and an energy balance - the integrator of the explicit
///        forming step (`form_explicit`, Forming.hpp, docs/forming.md).
///
/// **Equations of motion.** With the lumped (diagonal) mass M, the
/// mass-proportional damping \f$C = \alpha M\f$, the internal forces
/// \f$f_{int}(u)\f$ of the non-linear system (the elements, kinematics and
/// plasticity of NonlinearStatic.hpp, the plastic history of every point),
/// the loads \f$f_{ext}(t) = r(t)\,f\f$ of an optional load case and the
/// contact forces \f$f_c\f$ of the tools,
/// \f[
///   M\ddot u + C\dot u + f_{int}(u) = f_{ext}(t) + f_c(u, \dot u, t)
/// \f]
/// on the free DOFs; a prescribed DOF follows
/// \f$u_p(t) = u_{p,0} + r(t)\,(u_{p,1} - u_{p,0})\f$ (r a ramp, linear in
/// the physical time unless given).
///
/// **Central differences** (Belytschko, Liu and Moran, *Nonlinear Finite
/// Elements for Continua and Structures*, Wiley 2000, box 6.1), with the
/// velocities at the half steps and a step that may change between steps:
/// \f[
///   v_{n+1/2} = v_n + (t_{n+1/2} - t_n)\,a_n ,\quad
///   u_{n+1} = u_n + \Delta t_{n+1/2}\,v_{n+1/2} ,\quad
///   a_{n+1} = M^{-1}\big(f_{ext} - f_{int}(u_{n+1}) + f_c - \alpha M v_{n+1/2}\big) ,\quad
///   v_{n+1} = v_{n+1/2} + (t_{n+1} - t_{n+1/2})\,a_{n+1} .
/// \f]
/// The damping takes the half-step velocity (lagged by half a step, so the
/// update stays explicit); a prescribed DOF is set to \f$u_p(t_{n+1})\f$
/// directly (no drift) with \f$v_{n+1/2} = (u_p(t_{n+1}) - u_p(t_n))/\Delta t\f$.
/// Every step is final: the plastic history is updated in place at every
/// step, never iterated.
///
/// **Lumped mass**: the row sums of the consistent element masses (HRZ for
/// the Tet10), Assembler::assemble_mass. **Mass scaling** multiplies an
/// element's density by \f$s_e \ge 1\f$: uniform,
/// \f$s_e = (\Delta t_{target}/\Delta t_{crit})^2\f$ for every element;
/// selective (conventional, per element),
/// \f$s_e = \max\big(1, (\Delta t_{target}/\Delta t_e)^2\big)\f$, which adds
/// mass only to the elements that limit the step (the added mass is
/// reported, and warned about above a fraction); with `dynamic` selective
/// scaling the scales are raised at every stable-step update where an
/// element's step has fallen below the target (as a sheet thins under the
/// tool), keeping the velocities and booking the added kinetic energy
/// \f$W_m = \tfrac12\sum\Delta m\,v^2\f$ in the balance. Mass scaling and a faster
/// tool (time scaling) raise the inertia forces alike - by \f$s\f$ and by
/// \f$v^2\f$ - so the measure of a run's dynamics is the equivalent speed
/// \f$v\sqrt{s}\f$, and its cost (the number of steps) is inversely
/// proportional to it. (Selective mass scaling proper, a non-diagonal mass
/// that leaves the rigid-body inertia intact - Olovsson, Simonsson and
/// Unosson, IJNME 63 (2005) 1436-1445 - needs an iterative mass solve and is
/// not provided.) Body loads keep the physical density.
///
/// **Stable time step.** The central-difference method is stable for
/// \f$\omega_{max}\Delta t \le 2\f$. `ElementEigenvalue` (default) bounds
/// \f$\omega_{max}\f$ by the largest element eigenvalue,
/// \f$\omega_e^2 = \lambda_{max}(M_e^{-1/2}K_eM_e^{-1/2})\f$ with the linear
/// elastic element stiffness at the current configuration and the element's
/// lumped (scaled) mass - by Irons' theorem an upper bound of the assembled
/// system's; `PowerIteration` estimates \f$\omega_{max}\f$ of the assembled
/// \f$M^{-1}K\f$ without constraints (Rayleigh quotient, times 1.05; the
/// constraints can only lower it) - tighter, for the whole model only; `ElementLength` takes \f$L_e/c_e\f$ with
/// \f$L_e = V_e/A_{max}\f$ and the dilatational wave speed
/// \f$c_e = \sqrt{(\lambda + 2\mu)/(s_e\rho)}\f$ - the conventional estimate,
/// not a bound. With finite kinematics the estimate is repeated every
/// `update_every` steps on the current configuration (a thinning sheet
/// lowers it), the step never growing by more than 1 % at an update. The
/// damping and the contact penalty lower the limit to
/// \f$\omega^2\Delta t^2 + 2\alpha\Delta t \le 4 - s_c\f$ (below); the step
/// is `safety` times that limit.
///
/// **Contact** with rigid tools (sphere, plane, cylinder: the geometry and
/// trajectories of RigidTool.hpp) in the current configuration, per slave
/// node j and tool: where the gap \f$g < 0\f$, the normal force
/// \f$f_N = -k_j g\,n\f$ with the mass-based penalty
/// \f$k_j = s_c m_j/\Delta t^2\f$ (\f$m_j\f$ the node's lumped mass, \f$s_c\f$
/// `contact_stiffness`, default 0.5 - the "soft constraint" of explicit
/// codes, LS-DYNA theory manual): it adds at most \f$s_c/\Delta t^2\f$ to
/// \f$\omega^2\f$, so it never lowers the stable step by more than that,
/// unlike the implicit law \f$\kappa = sE/h\f$, which is stiffer still and
/// would. Its penetration, about \f$f\,\Delta t^2/(s_c m_j)\f$, does not
/// shrink with the tool speed (with mass scaling, \f$m_j/\Delta t^2\f$ is
/// fixed by the target step): it biases the formed shape by about the
/// penetration, so the largest penetration relative to the node's element
/// thickness is reported and warned about (`penetration_warning`).
/// Friction: regularised Coulomb friction with a committed
/// tangential force per node, transported onto the current tangent plane,
/// incremented by \f$-k_T P\,\Delta_{rel}\f$ (\f$k_T = \rho_T k_j\f$,
/// \f$\Delta_{rel}\f$ the node's motion relative to the tool over the step)
/// and returned onto the cone \f$|F_T| \le \mu|f_N|\f$; the stable step
/// reserves \f$s_c\max(1, \rho_T)\f$ (the stiffer of the two directions)
/// for a frictional tool. The tool's
/// reference point follows its trajectory at the pseudo-time the drive maps
/// the physical time to (ExplicitTimeMap).
///
/// **Energy balance.** Kinetic energy \f$T = \tfrac12 v^TMv\f$ (at the
/// integer steps), the work of the internal forces W_int, of the loads and
/// the reactions of the prescribed DOFs W_ext and of the contact forces
/// (normal and friction parts, on the body) W_c - trapezoidal sums
/// \f$\Delta u\cdot(f_n + f_{n+1})/2\f$ - and the damping dissipation
/// \f$D = \sum\Delta u\cdot\alpha M v_{n+1/2}\f$:
/// \f$E_{err} = T - T_0 + W_{int} + D - W_{ext} - W_c - W_m\f$, relative to the
/// largest energy of the run so far. The plastic dissipation is W_int less
/// the change of the stored (elastic and hardening) energy. Quasi-static
/// validity is judged by T over the internal energy of the state (the
/// stored energy at the start plus \f$W_{int}\f$) after the first contact and by the
/// balance (both warned about); a balance beyond `energy_limit` stops the
/// run, as do non-finite values and an inverted element.
///
/// **Internal forces.** A dedicated kernel for Hex8 (finite, logarithmic -
/// elastoplastic elements only - or small-strain kinematics; elastic, or
/// elastoplastic through the return of
/// Plasticity.hpp; mean dilatation) keeps the reference gradients and
/// weights of every point (one set on a uniform structured mesh), updates
/// the history in place and assembles by a gather over each node's
/// elements in element order - the same order the serial assembly of
/// NonlinearSystem sums them in, so the result is the same for any thread
/// count, bitwise. It is checked against the generic element dispatch at
/// the start of every run (a relative difference above 1e-10 falls back
/// to the generic path). Every other element, kinematics, material law or
/// load uses the generic dispatch, `NonlinearSystem::evaluate` - the single
/// entry point of the element technologies. Neither path allocates in the
/// dedicated kernel's loop.
///
/// **Units.** Strict SI: m, s (physical time; the tool trajectories are in
/// their own pseudo-time), kg, N, J.
