/// \brief Incremental-forming analysis: a sequence of quasi-static steps in
///        which rigid tools travel over the model along their trajectories
///        (`form`) and the model is then released from its tools and clamps
///        onto statically determinate supports to spring back (`release`).
///
/// **State.** The analysis carries one state from step to step: the
/// displacement u from the reference configuration, the internal variables
/// of every elastoplastic integration point, the friction history of every
/// tool's contact nodes (RigidTool.hpp) and the pseudo-time t. A step starts
/// where the previous one ended (or from an `AnalysisState` given to `run`,
/// a restart) and commits its history only at converged increments, so a
/// cut increment leaves no trace. The model's elements, kinematics
/// (`finite`, the total Lagrangian formulation, or `small_strain`) and J2
/// plasticity are those of the non-linear static analysis
/// (NonlinearStatic.hpp): internal forces, tangent, the pure-evaluate /
/// commit-on-convergence history and the mean dilatation of Q4 and Hex8 are
/// its `NonlinearSystem`. No load case acts: the tools and the prescribed
/// displacements drive the model.
///
/// **Constraints per step.** Each step has its own Dirichlet partition, a
/// list of displacement constraints (region, fixed components) with a mode:
/// `hold` keeps a constrained DOF where the step found it; `absolute` moves
/// it linearly over the step from there to the given value. A step that
/// lists no constraint takes the model's own boundary conditions, in
/// `absolute` mode (so a clamp with value 0 holds the reference position).
/// Every step's constraints must suppress every rigid-body motion of the
/// model (checked up front, naming the step and the free motions).
///
/// **Equilibrium of a step.** With s in [0, 1] the fraction of the step,
/// the prescribed DOFs at their values of s and the free DOFs f,
/// \f[
///   R_f(u, t) - (1 - s)\,R_{0f} = 0 ,\qquad
///   R = f_{int}(u) - f_{c}(u, t) ,
/// \f]
/// \f$f_c\f$ the penalty contact forces of the step's active tools at
/// pseudo-time \f$t(s)\f$ and \f$R_0 = R(u_0, t_0)\f$ the imbalance of the
/// start state on the step's free DOFs. For a step that keeps the partition
/// and the tools of the previous one, \f$R_{0f}\f$ is the previous step's
/// converged residual, within tolerance of zero; after a change it holds
/// the reactions of released constraints and the forces of removed tools,
/// which the step thereby ramps out linearly - the springback of a release.
/// A tool active in two consecutive steps must start the second where it
/// ended the first (refused otherwise: a gap between their windows over
/// which its path moves would make it jump, and the ramp would hide the
/// penetration). A tool that becomes active in contact has the force of its
/// penetration ramped in over the step, which is warned about.
///
/// **Increments.** A `form` step advances the pseudo-time over its window
/// (by default the union of its active tools' trajectories, starting no
/// earlier than the previous step ended) in increments such that no active
/// tool travels more than `max_tool_travel` (default half the smallest
/// slave-node size) in one; trajectory knots are reached exactly, so no
/// corner of a path is cut. A `release` step runs s from 0 to 1 in
/// `increments` equal parts (default 10). An increment that fails is halved
/// (up to `max_cuts` times in a row); one that converges in at most 4
/// iterations lets the next grow by 1.5, up to the step's cap.
///
/// **Newton's method** in each increment starts from the converged state
/// with the prescribed DOFs at their new values and the tools at their new
/// positions - when the prescribed DOFs move as a rigid motion of the body
/// (always so for statically determinate supports), the free DOFs move by
/// it too, linearised about the current configuration, rather than leave
/// the elements around the moved support nodes distorted - and takes the
/// consistent tangent (elements, contact and, with friction, its
/// non-symmetric part) with a line search on the energy - the
/// non-linear static analysis's: full step when \f$|g(1)| \le 0.8|g(0)|\f$,
/// else regula falsi, an element inversion or a node through a tool halving
/// the step; the full step's evaluation, tangent included, is kept as the
/// next iteration's. A node the correction would drive into a tool from
/// outside - without penalty stiffness in the tangent, it would overshoot
/// deep into the tool - joins the active set with the penalty extended to
/// its gap and the correction is solved again (a semismooth Newton step on
/// the predicted active set). It converges when both
/// \f$\|R_f - (1-s)R_{0f}\| \le \epsilon_R F_{ref}\f$ and the correction is
/// below \f$\epsilon_u\f$ times the increment of u - or the residual is at
/// its round-off floor, which includes the contact's (a gap subtracts
/// positions: a displacement is resolved only to the rounding of X + u) -
/// and the residual of the accepted state is checked again before its
/// history is committed. The reference force
/// \f$F_{ref}\f$ is the largest of the ramped imbalance, the reactions,
/// the contact forces and every such value met at a converged state of the
/// analysis so far (never zero): at the end of a release the external
/// forces and the reactions of determinate supports vanish, and a scale
/// made of them alone would leave the tolerance at zero.
///
/// **Linear algebra.** The free-free tangent's sparsity pattern is analysed
/// once per Dirichlet partition; each iteration scatters the values into it
/// through a cached index map and refactorises numerically: supernodal
/// Cholesky (CHOLMOD) for a symmetric positive definite tangent when
/// SuiteSparse is built in, else (or if it fails) \f$LDL^T\f$; LU (UMFPACK,
/// else Eigen's SparseLU) for a non-symmetric one or when \f$LDL^T\f$ meets
/// a vanishing pivot.
///
/// **Explicit forming** (`form_explicit`, ExplicitDynamics.hpp): the step's
/// tools follow their paths in physical time - the pseudo-time mapped by a
/// tool speed along the path or by a duration - and the model is integrated
/// by central differences with a lumped (optionally scaled) mass and the
/// mass-based penalty contact of the explicit integrator, its constraints
/// held (or moved linearly in physical time), from the analysis's state
/// (displacement, velocity, plastic history, friction history) to the
/// state handed on. The step records the tool forces every
/// `history_every` steps (averaged over them) and the energy balance.
/// A following implicit step starts quasi-statically (the velocity is
/// dropped): its start imbalance \f$R_{0f}\f$ then holds, besides the
/// reactions of released constraints and the forces of removed tools, the
/// inertia and damping forces of the explicit step's end, which a
/// `release` ramps out with the rest.
///
/// **Assumptions and limits.** Quasi-static (no inertia), isothermal; the
/// penalty leaves a penetration of about \f$p\,h/(sE)\f$; the elastoplastic
/// law is the additive split of the Green-Lagrange strain, meant for small
/// elastic strains (NonlinearStatic.hpp) - plastic strains of order one in
/// forming are beyond its accuracy for the stress, not for equilibrium; the
/// mesh is never refined, trimmed or remapped.
