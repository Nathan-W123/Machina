/// \brief One element of an elastoplastic analysis: internal force,
///        consistent tangent and updated internal variables from the return
///        of Plasticity.hpp (J2, or Hill48 and Chaboche) at each integration
///        point, with small-strain, finite (total Lagrangian, Green-Lagrange
///        strain) or logarithmic-strain finite kinematics.
///
/// **Small strain.** With the linear strain operator \f$B\f$ (the element's
/// own, in the 3-D Voigt order - a plane model's out-of-plane row carries the
/// plane-strain or mean-dilatation \f$\varepsilon_{33}\f$), the strain at a
/// point is \f$\varepsilon = Bu_e\f$ and
/// \f[
///   f_e = \int B^T\sigma\,dV ,\qquad K_e = \int B^T C\,B\,dV ,
/// \f]
/// with \f$\sigma\f$ and the consistent tangent \f$C\f$ of the return from
/// the last converged state.
///
/// **Finite kinematics** (large displacement and rotation, small strain).
/// The return takes the Green-Lagrange strain \f$E\f$ for the strain and
/// gives the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress \f$S\f$: the additive split
/// \f$E = E^e + E^p + E^\theta\f$ with \f$S = D E^e\f$, the elastoplastic
/// counterpart of the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff law and, like it, exact under
/// any rigid rotation and meant for strains that stay small (with small
/// strains the materially-non-linear-only relations may be written between
/// \f$S\f$ and \f$E\f$ at large displacement and rotation: Bathe, *Finite
/// Element Procedures*, 1996, ch. 6). Then
/// \f[
///   f_e = \int B_{NL}^T S\,dV_0 ,\qquad
///   K_e = \int B_{NL}^T C\,B_{NL}\,dV_0 + \int (G^T\mathbf{S}\,G)\otimes I\,dV_0
/// \f]
/// with the operators of TotalLagrangian.hpp. The thermal strain
/// \f$E^\theta\f$ is the Green strain of the free thermal stretch, as in
/// Hyperelastic.hpp, so a freely heated body is stress-free, but the elastic
/// stiffness is not rescaled by the thermal stretch as the Saint
/// Venant-Kirchhoff law's is (a relative difference of \f$\alpha\Delta T\f$
/// in a thermal stress, below the model's small-strain premise).
///
/// **Mean dilatation.** Plastic flow is isochoric. On an element with
/// several integration points (Q4, Hex8, Tet10) each point's dilatation is
/// then a constraint, and in plane strain and 3-D the constraints outnumber
/// the element's degrees of freedom: the element locks and overestimates the
/// collapse load (Nagtegaal, Parks and Rice 1974). The mean-dilatation
/// operator (Hughes 1980) replaces every point's dilatation by the element's
/// volume average, \f$\bar B = B + \tfrac{1}{3}\,m\,(\bar b - b)^T\f$ with
/// \f$b = B^T m\f$ the dilatation row, \f$\bar b\f$ its average and
/// \f$m = \{1,1,1,0,0,0\}\f$, which leaves one constraint per element. In
/// plane strain the average dilatation gives \f$\varepsilon_{33} =
/// (\bar\theta - \theta)/3\f$ at a point, zero on average. With finite
/// kinematics the same is done to the Green strain,
/// \f$\bar E = E + \tfrac{1}{3}\,m\,(\overline{\mathrm{tr}E} - \mathrm{tr}E)\f$,
/// which is objective and whose second variation adds
/// \f$\tfrac{1}{3}\,\mathrm{tr}S\,(\overline{G^TG} - G^TG)\otimes I\f$ to the
/// geometric stiffness; being derived from the strain, it keeps the tangent
/// symmetric and consistent. Plane stress has no incompressibility
/// constraint (the thickness strain is free) and keeps \f$B\f$. On a
/// constant-strain element (Tri3, Tet4) the average is the point value and
/// nothing changes - those elements lock.
///
/// **Logarithmic-strain finite kinematics** (large strain; Miehe, Apel and
/// Lambrecht 2002, *Anisotropic additive plasticity in the logarithmic
/// strain space*). Total Lagrangian: the return of Plasticity.hpp - the same
/// J2, Hill48, Chaboche, plane-stress and thermal return, unchanged - takes
/// the logarithmic strain \f$E_{\log} = \tfrac12\ln C\f$ of
/// LogarithmicStrain.hpp as its strain and gives the stress T conjugate to
/// it and \f$C_{alg} = dT/dE_{\log}\f$. The additive split
/// \f$E_{\log} = E_{\log}^e + E_{\log}^p\f$ with \f$T = D E_{\log}^e\f$ is
/// exact for a coaxial homogeneous stretch (the log strains of successive
/// coaxial stretches add), so uniaxial J2 at any strain is the 1-D law in
/// the log strain, with T the Kirchhoff stress; the plastic flow is
/// isochoric in \f$\det F\f$; the Hill48 axes are those of the reference
/// configuration and convect with the material; and the model is objective
/// (C, hence everything but the push-forward, ignores a superposed
/// rotation). With \f$dE_{\log} = P\,dE\f$ (P = \f$2\,\partial
/// E_{\log}/\partial C\f$) and \f$dE = B_{NL}\,du\f$,
/// \f[
///   S = P^T T ,\qquad f_e = \int B_{NL}^T S\,dV_0 ,\qquad
///   K_e = \int B_{NL}^T\big(P^T C_{alg} P + T : \mathbb{L}\big) B_{NL}\,dV_0
///       + \int (G^T\mathbf{S}\,G)\otimes I\,dV_0 ,
/// \f]
/// \f$T : \mathbb{L}\f$ the Hessian of \f$T : E_{\log}(E)\f$ at fixed T.
/// The elasticity is Hencky's (quadratic in \f$E_{\log}\f$), elastic
/// elements included. The thermal strain is the log strain of the free
/// thermal stretch \f$1 + \alpha\Delta T\f$ (the stretch of the finite
/// path), \f$\ln(1 + \alpha\Delta T)\,I\f$, which the return takes as the
/// change \f$\ln(1 + \alpha\Delta T)/\alpha\f$: a freely heated body is
/// stress-free. In plane stress the return finds \f$E_{\log,33}\f$ with
/// \f$T_{33} = 0\f$ (which is \f$S_{33} = 0\f$: the normal is principal),
/// and the thickness stretches by \f$\exp E_{\log,33}\f$. Since
/// \f$C = F^TF\f$ is positive definite at an inverted point too, where
/// \f$E_{\log}\f$ is that of a valid state with an axis reflected, every
/// point checks \f$\det F > 0\f$ and an inverted one throws SolverError
/// (a failed step).
///
/// *Mean dilatation* on the logarithmic volumetric strain: since
/// \f$\mathrm{tr}\,E_{\log} = \ln J\f$, the average replaces each point's
/// \f$\ln J\f$ by the element's volume average,
/// \f$\bar E_{\log} = E_{\log} + \tfrac13\,m\,(\overline{\ln J} - \ln J)\f$ -
/// exactly the log strain of the modified deformation
/// \f$\bar F = (\bar J/J)^{1/3}F\f$, so it stays objective. Its variation
/// is \f$\bar B = P B_{NL} + \tfrac13 m(\bar b - b)\f$ with
/// \f$b = m^TPB_{NL}\f$ the variation of \f$\ln J\f$, and the force is
/// \f$\int\bar B^T T\f$. The second variation of
/// \f$\int T : \bar E_{\log}\f$ at fixed T is
/// \f$\int (T - p\,m) : d^2E_{\log} + \big(\int p\big)\,d^2\overline{\ln J}\f$
/// with the Kirchhoff mean stress \f$p = \mathrm{tr}\,T/3\f$, and since
/// \f$\ln J = m : E_{\log}\f$ both are initial-stress terms of the
/// stress \f$T' = \mathrm{dev}\,T + \bar p\,m\f$ - the point's deviator
/// with the element's mean pressure \f$\bar p\f$:
/// \f[
///   K_e = \int \big[\bar B^T C_{alg}\bar B + B_{NL}^T(T' : \mathbb{L})B_{NL}
///         + (G^T\mathbf{S}'G)\otimes I\big] dV_0 ,\qquad S' = P^T T' ,
/// \f]
/// the classical mean-dilatation result, consistent (tested against the
/// derivative of the force) and assembled after all the element's returns.
///
/// *Stress recovery*: the Kirchhoff stress \f$\tau = F S F^T\f$ (with the
/// modified \f$\bar F\f$, \f$\bar F\bar S\bar F^T\f$, the same), the Cauchy
/// stress \f$\sigma = \tau/\bar J\f$ with \f$\bar J = \exp\mathrm{tr}\,\bar
/// E_{\log}\f$ (J itself without averaging), and the log strain itself.
