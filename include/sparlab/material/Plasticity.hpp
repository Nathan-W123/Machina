/// \brief Rate-independent plasticity at a material point: the backward-Euler
///        radial return of J2 (von Mises) plasticity and its consistent
///        tangent (Simo and Hughes 1998, boxes 3.1 and 3.2), and the general
///        closest-point return of Hill's 1948 anisotropic criterion with
///        multi-backstress Chaboche (Armstrong-Frederick) kinematic and Voce
///        isotropic hardening and its consistent tangent, in 3-D, plane
///        strain and plane stress.
///
/// **The law (J2, radial return).** The strain splits additively,
/// \f$\varepsilon = \varepsilon^e + \varepsilon^p + \varepsilon^\theta\f$ (the thermal strain
/// \f$\alpha\Delta T\,I\f$), the stress is \f$\sigma = D\varepsilon^e\f$, and
/// with the relative stress \f$\xi = \mathrm{dev}\,\sigma - \beta\f$ the
/// yield function is
/// \f[
///   f = \|\xi\| - \sqrt{2/3}\,\sigma_y(\bar\alpha) \le 0 ,
/// \f]
/// with associative flow \f$\dot\varepsilon^p = \dot\gamma\,n\f$,
/// \f$n = \xi/\|\xi\|\f$, the accumulated plastic strain
/// \f$\dot{\bar\alpha} = \sqrt{2/3}\,\dot\gamma\f$ and the back stress
/// \f$\dot\beta = \tfrac{2}{3}H_{kin}\,\dot\gamma\,n\f$
/// (IsotropicMaterial.hpp has \f$\sigma_y\f$).
///
/// **Integration.** From the state of the last converged step, the elastic
/// trial stress \f$s^{tr} = 2G\,\mathrm{dev}(\varepsilon - \varepsilon^p_n)\f$
/// either stays inside the yield surface or returns radially onto it:
/// \f$\Delta\gamma\f$ solves
/// \f[
///   \|\xi^{tr}\| - (2G + \tfrac{2}{3}H_{kin})\,\Delta\gamma
///   - \sqrt{2/3}\,\sigma_y(\bar\alpha_n + \sqrt{2/3}\,\Delta\gamma) = 0
/// \f]
/// (in closed form for linear hardening, by Newton with Voce saturation),
/// and \f$\sigma = \sigma^{tr} - 2G\Delta\gamma\,n\f$. The consistent tangent
/// is
/// \f[
///   C = K\,1\otimes 1 + 2G\theta\,(I - \tfrac{1}{3}1\otimes 1)
///       - 2G\bar\theta\,n\otimes n ,\quad
///   \theta = 1 - \frac{2G\Delta\gamma}{\|\xi^{tr}\|} ,\quad
///   \bar\theta = \frac{1}{1 + (\sigma_y' + H_{kin})/(3G)} - (1 - \theta) .
/// \f]
/// The return is exact for linear hardening under a strain increment that
/// keeps its direction, and first-order accurate otherwise.
///
/// **Idealisations.** Every point carries the full 3-D state (strain with
/// engineering shears, stress tensorial, in the Voigt order
/// \f$\{11, 22, 33, 12, 23, 31\}\f$). Plane strain returns with the given
/// \f$\varepsilon_{33}\f$ (0, or the B-bar value of Elastoplastic.hpp).
/// Plane stress finds \f$\varepsilon_{33}\f$ by Newton so that
/// \f$\sigma_{33} = 0\f$ and condenses it out of the tangent,
/// \f$C_{ab} - C_{a3}C_{3b}/C_{33}\f$ (valid for a non-symmetric C too).
///
/// **Hill48 and Chaboche: the general return.** With the Hill48 criterion
/// or Armstrong-Frederick backstresses (PlasticityParameters::general())
/// the return is a closest-point projection (Simo and Hughes 1998, box 3.4;
/// Simo and Taylor 1986) of the elastic trial state onto
/// \f[
///   f = \bar\sigma(\xi) - \sigma_y(\bar\alpha) \le 0 ,\qquad
///   \bar\sigma(\xi) = \sqrt{\xi^T P\,\xi} ,\qquad
///   \xi = \sigma - \textstyle\sum_i \alpha_i ,
/// \f]
/// P the yield matrix of IsotropicMaterial.hpp (tensorial Voigt components,
/// global axes; its normal rows sum to zero, so f ignores the pressure). The
/// flow is associative, \f$\dot\varepsilon^p = \dot\lambda\,m\f$ with
/// \f$m = \partial\bar\sigma/\partial\sigma = P\xi/\bar\sigma\f$ -
/// which, differentiated by Voigt components, is the *engineering* form of
/// the flow tensor, \f$m_t = S^{-1}m\f$ its tensorial form with
/// \f$S = \mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,2,2,2)\f$ - and \f$\bar\alpha\f$ grows by
/// \f$\dot\lambda\f$, the work-conjugate equivalent plastic strain
/// (\f$\xi : \dot\varepsilon^p = \bar\sigma\dot\lambda\f$, P being
/// quadratic). For von Mises, \f$m_t = \sqrt{3/2}\,n\f$ and
/// \f$\Delta\lambda = \sqrt{2/3}\,\Delta\gamma\f$, the radial return's
/// accumulated strain. The backstresses (Chaboche 1986; Armstrong and
/// Frederick 1966) evolve as
/// \f$\dot\alpha_i = \tfrac{2}{3}C_i\,\dot\varepsilon^p_t - \gamma_i\,\alpha_i\,\dot\lambda\f$,
/// Prager's \f$H_{kin}\f$ joining them as one with \f$\gamma = 0\f$.
///
/// *The discrete equations.* Over a step with the flow direction of its
/// end, each backstress is
/// \f$\alpha_i = \theta_i\,\alpha_{i,n} + \tfrac{2}{3}C_i\,\chi_i\,m_t\f$ with
/// \f$\theta = e^{-\gamma\Delta\lambda}\f$,
/// \f$\chi = (1 - e^{-\gamma\Delta\lambda})/\gamma\f$ (exponential: the
/// exact solution of the linear ODE for a fixed \f$m_t\f$;
/// \f$\theta' = -\gamma\theta\f$, \f$\chi' = \theta\f$), or

/// (backward Euler; \f$\theta' = -\gamma\theta^2\f$, \f$\chi' = \theta^2\f$).
/// The elasticity is isotropic and \f$m\f$ deviatoric, so
/// \f$\sigma = \sigma^{tr} - 2G\Delta\lambda\,m_t\f$ and, the backstresses
/// eliminated in closed form,

/// stress, for a step so large that this is more), and then one more full
/// Newton step, which takes the residual to round-off: the state is rebuilt
/// from \f$(\Delta\lambda, m_t)\f$, and its yield function differs from
/// \f$R_2\f$ by about \f$m\cdot R_1\f$. The yield function of the returned
/// state is then round-off (at most \f$10^{-13}\sigma_y\f$, tested), so the
/// elastic re-check of stress recovery, from the committed state at the
/// converged strain, stays elastic; in plane stress for the same reason the
/// general return drives \f$\sigma_{33}\f$ to \f$10^{-13}\f$ of the stress
/// (the radial return keeps its \f$10^{-12}\f$). A line search that stalls
/// counts as converged only within four times the tolerance.

/// Hill48 with backstresses is in general not proportional even in uniaxial
