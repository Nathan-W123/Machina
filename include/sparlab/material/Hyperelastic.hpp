/// \brief Material laws of the large-deformation (total Lagrangian) analysis:
///        the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress and its tangent as functions of
///        the deformation gradient.
///
/// Both laws derive from a strain energy density \f$W\f$ per unit reference
/// volume, so \f$S = \partial W/\partial E\f$ and the tangent
/// \f$\mathbb{C} = \partial S/\partial E\f$ is symmetric, with the Green-Lagrange
/// strain \f$E = \tfrac12(F^T F - I)\f$ and \f$C = F^T F\f$.
///
/// * **Saint Venant-Kirchhoff**: \f$S = D\,(E - E_\theta)/\vartheta\f$ with
///   the same constitutive matrix \f$D\f$ as the linear analysis (plane
///   stress, plane strain or 3-D). A temperature change enters through the
///   multiplicative split \f$F = F_e\,\vartheta I\f$ with the thermal stretch
///   \f$\vartheta = 1 + \alpha\Delta T\f$ (Lu and Pister, 1975): the thermal
///   strain \f$E_\theta = \alpha\Delta T\,(1 + \alpha\Delta T/2)\f$ in each
///   direction is the Green-Lagrange strain of the free stretch, so a freely
///   heated body takes exactly \f$\vartheta\f$ with no stress, and the elastic
///   energy \f$\tfrac12 E_e : D : E_e\f$ is counted per unit volume of the
///   expanded, stress-free state, so that the material keeps its modulus
///   there: \f$W = \vartheta^3\,\tfrac12 E_e : D : E_e\f$ per reference
///   volume with \f$E_e = (E - E_\theta)/\vartheta^2\f$. (Subtracting
///   \f$E_\theta\f$ from \f$E\f$ alone would stiffen a heated material by
///   \f$\vartheta\f$.) To first order in \f$\alpha\Delta T\f$ this is the
///   linear analysis's thermal strain; \f$E_\theta\f$ is IsotropicMaterial's
///   linear thermal strain at the effective change
///   `thermal_green_lagrange_change`.
///   It is linear elasticity written in the Lagrangian strain: exact for
///   large rotations, and the right model for large deflection with small
///   strain - a slender beam, a plate, a shell-like part. Under strong
///   compression (a stretch below about 0.58 in uniaxial compression) its
///   stress falls again and the model is unsuitable; it is also what
///   CalculiX's linear elastic material becomes under NLGEOM.
/// * **Compressible neo-Hookean**:
///   \f$W = \tfrac{\mu}{2}(\mathrm{tr}\,C - 3) - \mu\ln J + \tfrac{\lambda}{2}(\ln J)^2\f$,
///   \f$S = \mu(I - C^{-1}) + \lambda\ln J\,C^{-1}\f$,
///   \f$\mathbb{C}_{ijkl} = \lambda C^{-1}_{ij}C^{-1}_{kl} +
///   (\mu - \lambda\ln J)(C^{-1}_{ik}C^{-1}_{jl} + C^{-1}_{il}C^{-1}_{jk})\f$,
///   with the Lame constants of the small-strain limit, so both laws agree
///   with linear elasticity for small strains. It stays stable in large
///   compression (\f$W\to\infty\f$ as \f$J\to0\f$) and suits rubber-like
///   large strain. It is available for plane strain (\f$F_{33} = 1\f$) and
///   3-D; plane stress would need the thickness stretch as an extra unknown
///   and is refused, as is a thermal strain.
///
/// Voigt ordering follows IsotropicMaterial (\f$\{11, 22, 12\}\f$ in 2-D,
/// \f$\{11, 22, 33, 12, 23, 31\}\f$ in 3-D) with engineering shear strain,
/// so the tangent's entries are \f$\mathbb{C}_{ijkl}\f$ for the index pairs of
/// the row and the column.
