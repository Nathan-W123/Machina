# Combined compensation on pyramid-s2026-0001: DSIF rim pass + transfer model + optimiser

**SparLab simulation** (sparlab_form). **One test part: not statistically meaningful.** Predictions are the surrogate's (the stage_n26 MLP, or that MLP with the transfer correction), not results.

All simulated rows at penalty 10 (`springback_fine` preset). Deviation formed - target, vertical, in mm; upper band = the top 1 mm of depth (next to the clamp), deep = the rest of the part.

| case | kind | FE runs | vertical RMS | upper-band RMS | upper-band bias | deep RMS | deep bias | note |

FE runs: SparLab runs of this part for that row (the plate rows' ML models were trained on separate data runs; the combined row also needed the 12 rim-pass training runs below).

Combined: surrogate DA (stagnation, 2 s), then the optimiser (5 evaluation batches, 89 s, stop 'no_improvement', in envelope True, largest change from the DA command 0.217 mm). Adjusted: the deep region (2273 nodes, the part minus the 1640-node band the rim pass sweeps); the band and the flange are held at the target. Envelope override: False.

## Base vs transfer model on the rim-pass data

dz prediction error (RMS over the part, mean over parts) of the stage_n26 MLP (base, backing plate, penalty 3) and of the base + linear TransferModel correction, on the rim-pass runs (penalty 10):

| evaluation | parts | base [mm] | transfer [mm] |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| leave-one-part-out over the fit parts (the model used) | 8 | 0.486 | 0.100 |
| leave-one-part-out, all 12 parts (separate fit) | 12 | 0.499 | 0.104 |
| held out from the correction | 4 | 0.526 | 0.124 |

(dz RMS of the held-out runs: 0.408 mm.) Correction (offset a [m], gain b; y = a + (1 + b) mu): [0.00042010037702198586, -0.18603209592800898]. the 12 parts are TRAIN parts of the base MLP (with the backing plate at penalty 3): 'held out' means held out from the transfer correction, not unseen geometry.

## The 12 training parts (TRAIN split of stage_n26, 3 per family)

Picked per family among the TRAIN parts whose penalty-3 data run took at most the family median (cost cap), as the 3 farthest apart in standardised (footprint, depth, wall angle); the one nearest their centroid is held out from the correction. Uncompensated target, DSIF + rim pass, penalty 10.
