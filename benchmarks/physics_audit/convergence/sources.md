  "Study on the influence of the refinement of a 3-D finite element mesh in
  springback evaluation of plane-strain channel sections", AIP Conf. Proc. 908
  (NUMIFORM 2007) - abstract: solid elements are recommended for springback
  when tool radius / thickness < 5-6 (here 4 mm / 1 mm = 4), and "the in-plane
  to thickness FE size ratio is more relevant than the number of FE layers
  through-thickness". https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21061767
* This repository: `docs/forming.md` sections 5-7 (costs, the standard Hex8's
  bending stiffness, the explicit step, its kernel covering only the standard
  2 x 2 x 2 Hex8 and the generic dispatch at ~35 times the cost, the smoke
  study's 3.5 % springback difference at 7.1 m/s); `docs/verification.md`
  section 27 (one IM layer with 5 / 7 points within 3.5 % / 0.9 % of beam
  theory on a bent strip) and "What is not covered" ("the springback of the
  SPIF cases is not mesh-converged").
