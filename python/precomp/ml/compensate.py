"""Compensation on a learned surrogate, and its honest end-to-end check.

`surrogate_compensate` runs displacement adjustment (`precomp.compensation`)
with the surrogate as the predictor of the formed surface,

    formed(c) = c + dz_hat(c),

one iteration at a time so that it can stop when the PREDICTED deviation from
the target is within tolerance or stops improving (stagnation) - or, as an
option, within the model's own interval half-width. It returns the
compensated commanded surface (the best predicted iterate), the predicted
formed surface, the predicted residual deviation from the target with its
conformal interval, the out-of-distribution report of the compensated shape,
and the history - all predictions, labelled with the data source the model
learned from.

The envelope is enforced, not only reported: a target outside the model's
training envelope is refused, and every iterate is assessed before the model
is evaluated on it - the first one outside ends the loop ("left_envelope"),
keeping the best iterate inside - unless `allow_out_of_envelope`, in which
case the verdicts are recorded in the history and the result.

`surrogate_optimize` goes further than DA's pointwise update: starting from
the DA command it searches a smooth, low-dimensional correction field (depth
level x angle) that minimises the predicted deviation over the part, under
the same constraints and the envelope, with a penalty on the model's std.

A prediction is not a result. `verify_with_fea` simulates the compensated
shape with sparlab_form and reports the achieved deviation from the target
(and, optionally, that of the uncompensated target for the improvement
factor): the check to run before trusting a surrogate compensation.
`verify_with_simulator` does the same through any `Simulator`, e.g. the
ProxySimulator for CI - labelled "proxy - not physics".

    recorded in the command's metadata. J is a sum of squares: a
    Levenberg-Marquardt iteration with a finite-difference Jacobian (step
    `fd_step` [m] per parameter, central unless not `central`: one
    evaluation batch of 2n (n) predictions), then a full and a half step
    per damping in `dampings` (relative to the mean diagonal of J^T J),
    each limited to `max_step` [m] in the command and |p| <=
    `max_correction` [m]. The difference probes are candidates too: a
    learned surrogate is rough at the scale of tens of microns (on the
    fine-mesh MLP most smooth 25 um perturbations of the DA command made
    the predicted RMS worse in both directions), where a Gauss-Newton
    step alone stalls. The best candidate that
    lowers J by more than `rel_tol` (relative) and whose command is inside
    the training envelope is accepted (one outside is rejected, unless
    `allow_out_of_envelope`). It stops after `max_iterations`, at no
    accepted step, or at `max_time_s` (not starting a batch the last one's
    duration says would end after it; checked between predictions).

    start : the starting command - a HeightMap, a SurrogateCompensation, or
        None to run `surrogate_compensate` with `da_kwargs` and the
        constraint keywords here.
    Returns a SurrogateCompensation with stopped = "optimizer" (the reason
    in `history[-1]["stop_reason"]` and the command's metadata), the best
    accepted iterate (the start if none), and a history entry per
    evaluation batch (the predicted RMS of its accepted or best candidate
    in "error").
