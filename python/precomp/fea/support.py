"""Rim support in the forming deck: a backing plate, or a DSIF support tool.

A single tool pushing from above cannot keep the sheet between the clamp and
the first contour from bending down: the released part comes out too deep
near its rim (`benchmarks/springback`). `FormingSetup.support` adds support
from below, with the existing rigid tools of `sparlab_form`
(docs/forming.md):

* ``"backing_plate"`` - a rigid plate under the sheet whose opening is the
  part's outline grown by `clearance` (partial support die). It is a
  `plane` tool (normal +z, through the sheet's bottom z = -t), held still,
  whose slave surface is the bottom faces lying wholly outside the opening:
  their nodes are listed by id (`node_ids`, the structured mesh's documented
  numbering, include/sparlab/mesh/StructuredMesh.hpp), since no geometric
  region primitive describes an arbitrary outline. The sheet outside the
  opening cannot go below the plate; nothing holds it down onto the plate.
  On the mesh the opening is the union of the elements it touches, up to
  one element wider than asked: `plate_nodes` reports the clearance the
  mesh realises, the smallest distance of a carried node to the outline
  (`outline_distance`). The plate is active in "form" and removed with the
  tool in "unload" (clamp still on), before the 3-2-1 release.
* ``"dsif"`` - double-sided incremental forming: a second ball (the
  support) under the sheet, on the bottom faces of the free window,
  following `precomp.toolpath.dsif_support_points` - opposite the forming
  tool along the surface normal, never above the sheet not yet formed -
  written with the forming tool's pseudo-time, so both tools move together
  in one "form" step; "unload" removes both. With `rim_pass`, after that
  unload the support alone runs `precomp.toolpath.rim_pass_path` (step
  "rim_pass", pseudo-time 2 to 3, clamp on) and is removed in "rim_unload",
  before the release.

What a command above the sheet plane means (`command_upper_bound`): the
forming tool presses from above and its path is made for the part of the
command below the plane (`precomp.fea.deck.make_toolpath`); a backing
plate at the sheet's bottom holds the sheet up to the plane outside the
opening but pushes nothing higher; the DSIF support pushes up only
opposite the forming tool, whose path never rises above the plane. Only
the rim pass pushes the sheet up by itself: in the band it sweeps (signed
distance to the target's outline in [-rim_inside, rim_outside], the flange
strip included, which displacement adjustment then adjusts instead of
holding - `compensation_masks`) the command may rise above the plane, by at
most `rim_max_raise` and no further than the rim pass written for it pushes
the sheet: the top of the volume its ball sweeps along its loops
(`precomp.toolpath.swept_ball_top`), plus the sheet thickness. The loops sit
at the lift cutter of the commanded underside, so a raise narrower than the
ball, a corner seen from below tighter than it, or a raise between two loops
is out of reach; `command_upper_bound` cuts the command to what the ball
reaches, to a fixed point. Every other command is kept at z <= 0 (to within
`COMMAND_TOLERANCE`), and `build_deck` refuses one above the bound.

All lengths are metres.

    0 (the sheet plane) everywhere for every strategy but the DSIF rim

    and the synchronised support push nothing above the plane. With the rim
    pass, on the band and strip it sweeps (`rim_band`), the command may rise
    above the plane by at most `rim_max_raise`, and only as far as the rim
    pass written for it pushes the sheet: `rim_pass_reach` of `rim_pass` -
    the top of the volume the ball sweeps along its loops, plus t. The loops
    sit at the lift cutter of the command's underside, so a raised band
    narrower than the ball, a corner seen from below tighter than it (the
    part's rim), the outermost loop held down by the flange beside it, or a
    raise between two loops cannot be pushed up by it and is cut to what the
    ball reaches (never below the plane). The cut lowers the underside the
    loops follow, so it is repeated on the cut command until an iteration
    changes it by at most `BOUND_CONVERGENCE` (at most `BOUND_ITERATIONS`
    times): the rim pass made for a command at or below the bound then
    reaches it (`check_command` verifies exactly that). Where nothing is
    raised the bound is `rim_max_raise` on the band (nothing to check).
