"""The sparlab_form input deck.

`build_deck` writes, into one directory,

* `deck.json` - a SparLab JSON deck (`docs/configuration.md`): mesh,
  material, model and the `forming` block of `docs/forming.md` (section 2)
  with the tool, the ordered steps and their constraints, the kinematics,
  the Newton settings and the output. It has no top-level
  `boundary_conditions`, `load_cases` or `nonlinear` block: every step lists
  its own constraints, the forming analysis applies no load case, and
  sparlab_form reads no `nonlinear` block. Every key is one sparlab_form
  reads - the runner runs it with `--strict-config`, which refuses any other;
* `toolpath.csv` - the tool-centre trajectory, columns `t,x,y,z`, t strictly
  increasing from 0 to 1;
* `commanded.npz`, `precomp_deck.json` - the commanded surface and the
  setup, for provenance. The solver does not read them and they are not part
  of the content hash.

The `forming` keys are written in one place, `forming_block`, so a change of
the C++ contract is a change here only.

Geometry: the blank is a structured mesh of the square [-L/2, L/2]^2 by
[-t, 0], L the blank size rounded to whole elements; the clamp fixes every
node (through the thickness) whose x or y lies within `clamp_margin` of the
blank edge; the tool contacts the top faces (z = 0) inside the clamp; the
3-2-1 release support fixes x, y, z of the top node nearest (-a, -a, 0), y
and z of the one nearest (a, -a, 0) and z of the one nearest (-a, a, 0),
with a = L/2 - clamp_margin / 2 (three flange points in the former clamp):
six constraints, no rigid-body mode left and no constraint on the
springback.

Steps: "form" (the tool follows the trajectory from t = 0 to its last point
in contact with the part, clamp held: the shape under the tool), "unload"
(a release: the tool is removed and its force ramped out, clamp held - the
springback in the fixture) and, with release "321", "release" (the clamp
replaced by the 3-2-1 support - the free springback). The final retract of
the trajectory is not simulated: the "unload" step takes the tool away.

Support (`FormingSetup.support`, `precomp.fea.support`): a backing plate
("plate", a still plane under the sheet outside an opening around the part)
or a DSIF support ball ("support", under the sheet, its trajectory
`support_path.csv` on the forming tool's pseudo-time) is active in "form"
beside the tool and removed with it in "unload". With the DSIF rim pass,
"rim_pass" (the support alone, pseudo-time from 2) and "rim_unload" (its
removal) follow "unload", clamp held. The plate's opening and the rim pass
band follow the outline of `target` (the part the fixture is made for),
the commanded surface's when none is given.

Every step constraint is `"mode": "hold"`: its DOFs stay where the step
finds them - the clamp at the reference position, the three support nodes
where the clamp left them, so the released part keeps its place on the
fixture. sparlab_form warns that the clamp of "unload" holds reactions (it
is not statically determinate): that is the springback the fixture
prevents, which "release" lets go.
