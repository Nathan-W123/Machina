"""precomp - springback pre-compensation for robotic incremental sheet forming.

The Python layer around the SparLab forming solver: part geometry, tool paths,
the forming deck and its results, scan metrology, displacement-adjustment
compensation, robot compliance and reporting. Machine-learned surrogates live
in `precomp.ml`, which is built on the public API of the modules below.

Units are strict SI everywhere (m, N, Pa, s), as in SparLab
(`docs/conventions.md`); angles carry their unit in their name (`_deg`,
`_rad`). A millimetre value appears only in a human-facing report string,
labelled as such.
