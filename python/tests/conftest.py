"""Shared fixtures of the precomp test suite.

The package is imported from the source tree (python/), so the tests run
without installing it. `fake_solver` is an executable wrapper around
`fake_sparlab_form.py`, a test double that writes contract-conforming result
directories; the real sparlab_form is only used by test_integration_sparlab.py,
which is skipped when build/bin/sparlab_form is absent.

The precomp.ml tests share one proxy data set and one trained surrogate
(session fixtures below). Every number they produce comes from the
ProxySimulator - an analytic stand-in, NOT physics. Threads are capped at two
(the machine is shared).
